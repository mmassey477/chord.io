# Chord

Chord is built using a full-stack JavaScript open-source solution, incorperating [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/). For more information see [MEANJS](https://github.com/meanjs/mean).

## Running things locally
You'll have better luck if your operating system is Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver). Everything will only fit if you have more than ~1GB of free space. Your dev setup should probably be in the neighborhood of >8GB ram and >2.5GHz cpu to get performance that's not completely slow and annoying. We have used Docker to handle the rest of the environment configuration, so after you've got the basics, everything else should be taken care of.
