1. A big part of a web development project is the initial setup. For this week I will first have to create a docker environment, install all of the many dependencies, and integrate the Spotify api. I can then create my Angular application and begin working on the actual code. As for the actual project, by this week I plan to have the login screen and the sign up page fully working. This will include the front end aspects, like the username bar, the password bar and the “Don’t have an account? Sign up now” link. The link will need to redirect users to the Spotify page and then have them come back and use the account they just created. The backend for all of this will be saving the user object that is created when the user signs up. I will call a function on the application server that will update a last logged in field of the object and then save it to the Mongo database under the collection users. If it can successfully find the user in the database the backend will serve that user to the front end and redirect them to the next page. If it doesn’t find them I will return a server error code that will mean wrong username or password.

2. For this deadline I unfortunatley ran into many difficulties. For one, I could not figure out why my npm dependecies were not loading correctly but I finally realized I needed to downgrade Docker from version 9 to version 8 for whatever reasons (This took many hours of research). Another difficulty has been with Spotify and their crazy complex authentication process. I have used the oauth 1.0 framework before but Spotify is using the "better" version 2.0. Basically there are different tokens that all changing and timing out that I have to keep track of. On top of that they use a redirect uri to send a code as a Get method to my frontend instead of just returning it in their delayed response. All in all I got the functionality working well which is definatley not evident on the front end, but did take many hours of research. As I had stated in number one, I knew a big part of this first turn in would be for setup. Now that I have all of the setup done I can finally start coding the actual website and making everything look pretty. 

3. My plan from the proposal was as follows: "At this point I would like to have the Spotify API fully incorporated. I will begin by installing the api with npm. This will allow me to send requests to Spotify to manipulate and receive song data, queue data, and user data. I will need to read their documentation on the methods to add songs to queues, search songs, log a user into spotify and get the song data. These methods will be called by the backend of my application which in turn get called from http request sent from the front end by the application users." Basically I will need to finish logging in users and then using the access token to call methods of the API. 

4. Unfortunately I don't have a lot on the front end setup yet so the pictures are mostly of code and docker logs.
